# 🎮 Computer-Vision-Enabled-Gesture-Control-Pong-Game-Using-Hand-Gestures
This project implements a gesture-controlled Pong game using computer vision and deep learning. A webcam tracks hand movements in real time to control paddles without physical controllers, enabling smooth, touch-free gameplay and demonstrating natural human–computer interaction.
